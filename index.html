            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I was raised in Edwardsville, Illinois, about 30 minutes from St. Louis. I graduated with honors from 
                Edwardsville High School in 2022 and began attending the University of Dayton shortly after. I am currently 
                pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in cybersecurity, expecting to 
                graduate in May 2026.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest in technology started early, my first taste of programming came from downloading games onto my 
                TI-84 calculator. From there, I took programming classes in high school and eventually built my own PC so I 
                could work on more advanced projects than my school-issued Chromebook allowed. Since starting college, I’ve 
                discovered a strong interest in cybersecurity and web development.

            <h3>College Work</h3>
            <p>
                I began my studies at the University of Dayton in August 2022, where I have enjoyed expanding my knowledge 
                of computer science. My freshman year focused on programming fundamentals, algorithms, and computer 
                architecture. 
            </p>
            <p>
                During my sophomore year, I completed advanced courses such as Data Structures and Algorithms and Concepts 
                and Implementation of Programming Languages. I also took my first AI and machine learning course, where my 
                <a href="assets/352-Machine-Learning-Final.pdf" target="_blank" alt="Download machine learning final pdf">final project</a>
                 involved building a basic data classification model.
            </p>
            <p>
                Continuing in my junior year and have completed key foundational courses, including Operating Systems and 
                Analysis of Algorithms, Computer Networking, Cloud Application Development, and Web 
                Application Programming and Hacking; courses that have strengthened my interest in cybersecurity, 
                full-stack development, and cloud systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently in my senior year, taking courses such as Cybersecurity fundamentals, Secure Application Development,
                and my senior capstone project. My expected graduation date is May 2026, and I plan to continue 
                developing my skills in the areas of cybersecurity and web development.
